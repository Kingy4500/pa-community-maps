# PLANETARY ANNIHILATION INC CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT

This contributor license agreement (this “CLA”) documents the rights granted by contributors to Planetary Annihilation Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PA,” “we,” or “us”). This is a legally binding agreement, so please read it carefully before agreeing to it.

The purpose of this CLA is to clarify the intellectual property license that any person grants to us when they make a Contribution. Accordingly, before you may make a Contribution, you must sign this CLA and deliver it to us. This CLA is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of PA, and this CLA does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

By signing below, You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to PA. Except for the licenses granted in this CLA to PA and recipients of software or video games distributed by PA, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.

    “You” (or “Your”) means the undersigned copyright owner that is entering into this CLA with PA.
“Contribution” means any original work of authorship, including, without limitation, any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to PA for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by PA (the “Work”). For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to PA or its representatives, including, without limitation, communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, PA for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”

2. Copyright License.

    2.1	You retain ownership of the copyright in Your Contribution and have the same rights to use or license the Contribution that You would have had without entering into this CLA.

    2.2	You hereby grant to PA and to third-party recipients of the Work a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license (with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of sublicensees) to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3.	Patent License.

    For patent claims (each, a “Licensed Patent”), including, without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims that You own, control, or have the right to grant, now or in the future, You hereby grant to PA and to third-party recipients of the Work a non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license (with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of sublicensees) to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution alone or by combination of Your Contribution with the Work to which such Contribution was submitted. The term of the license for each Licensed Patent will commence on the date the applicable Contribution is made and end on the expiration of the applicable Licensed Patent.

4.	Moral Rights.

    If moral rights apply to any Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights against us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees or sublicensees, either direct or indirect.

5.	Your Representations.

    5.1	You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the licenses described in this CLA. If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to PA, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with PA.

    5.2	You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, without limitation, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and that are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

    5.3	You agree to notify PA of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make any of the representations contained in this CLA inaccurate in any respect.

6.	Your Disclaimers.

    You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Except as provided in this CLA or required by applicable law, You provide Your Contributions on an “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7.	Miscellaneous.

    7.1	This CLA will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, excluding its conflicts of law provisions.

    7.2	If any provision of this CLA is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and that is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this CLA shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this CLA or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.

    7.3	This CLA sets out the entire agreement between You and PA for Your Contributions to PA and overrides all other agreements or understandings.
